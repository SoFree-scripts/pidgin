Fun example of SoFplus communicating with Python to allow sending/receiving of messages while on the desktop.

Strings with 'http' in them are clickable.

Python checks the logfile for any new lines and pastes them into the tkinter text widget as they come.
SoFplus will print the string that you type into tkinter.

Plenty of improvements to be made as this is just a proof of concept-
*colours / SoF1 chars not handled
*a way of notifying you of new messages (e.g make the tab flash orange on/off on new messages)
